First TOP project practice using HTML

This Project will not use CSS, the aim is to create the backbone of the recipes websites and also to practice linking and probably adding images. 
I predict that the skills to be worked on will include
- Creating HTML and basic setup code <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <body>
- Linking <a href="" target="blankd" rel="noopener noreferrer">
- Adding images <img src>
- Git Commit
- Writing BETTER commit messages

Self Reflection (After project is finished):
- I'm much more confident with setting up the boilerplate template for html files.
- I'm much more confident with adding links, images, resizing images, and also with writing better commit messages for git
- I needed the practice of the simple git commands from the terminal
- It seemed a little tedious at first, however the assignment was very good at helping me gain muscle memory of the git commands, and also the tags for HTML and how to set everything up. 
- I wasn't sure how to add appropriate spacing between pictures on the list, as it was all messy at first, so I used <p></p> between each list item to ensure a new line. 
I am curious to learn how to set it up better in the future. 
- All in all, I'm very grateful for this project. It's nice to start with an easier project and gain both some confidence and skills in html. 

Thank you The Odin Project team and everyone who put their time, effort, knowledge and experience into creating this course for people around the world like me :)
