First TOP project practice using HTML

This Project will not use CSS, the aim is to create the backbone of the recipes websites and also to practice linking and probably adding images. 
I predict that the skills to be worked on will include
- Creating HTML and basic setup code <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <body>
- Linking <a href="" target="blankd" rel="noopener noreferrer">
- Adding images <img src>
- Git Commit
- Writing BETTER commit messages

Self Reflection (After project is finished):
