        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time! They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs. Perfect for during the week as the slow cooker does most of the work!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 cup water into the slow cooker, then add ribs. Scatter onion and garlic over top. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or High for 4 hours.</li>
